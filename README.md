# AI-Powered Resume Scanner & Job Matcher

![AI Resume Scanner Showcase](httpshttps://github.com/Robel231/ai-resume-scanner/blob/main/showcase.gif?raw=true)

This is a full-stack web application designed to demystify the job application process. It provides users with instant, AI-driven feedback on how their resume aligns with a specific job description.

The application is built with a modern, scalable, and production-ready architecture. It features a secure authentication system, a robust FastAPI backend that orchestrates AI analysis and data persistence, and a luxurious, fully interactive frontend built with Next.js.

The goal of this project was to build a complete, end-to-end product that solves a real-world problem for job seekers, demonstrating skills in backend development, frontend design, AI integration, and DevOps.

## üöÄ Running Locally

This project is fully containerized, making local setup incredibly simple and reliable.

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
-   An AI provider API Key (e.g., from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/)).

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Robel231/ai-resume-scanner.git
    cd ai-resume-scanner
    ```

2.  **Create your environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file. This file contains all the necessary variables your application needs.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Fill in your secrets:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and add your own secret keys for `JWT_SECRET_KEY` and your `GROQ_API_KEY`.

4.  **Build and run the application:**
    This single command will build the images for all services (API, frontend, DB, Redis) and start them in a networked environment.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

5.  **Access the application:**
    -   **Frontend UI:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    -   **Backend API Docs:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
